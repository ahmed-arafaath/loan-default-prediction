# Loan Default Predictor
A Machine learning model to predict loan payback ability of new borrowers, the goal of this project was to get familiar with exploratory data analysis, feature selection and various machine learning model implementation.


Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier and kNN Algorithm.

This dataset contains 80,000 rows and 88 columns, loan_default is the output column for prediction match.


Successfully implemented 3 different machine learning model and achieved with the highest of 81% accuracy with Logistic Regression followed by 79% accuracy with k-nearest-neighbor and 75% accuracy with Naive Bayes Classifier.
